After the data is returned, it is processed and used to set the `Artist` class' attributes. Both the method associated with the `Artist` class and function defined below utilize a function from the <a href=\"https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.24.0/\">Spotipy</a> library to make API calls and then parse the data.\n\n```{python}\n#| eval: false \n# data_functions.py\nimport spotipy\nfrom data_classes import Artist\n\ndef collect_top_artists(key, time_period, n_artists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Collects the user's top Spotify artists.\n\n    Retrieves the user's top artists over a given time period from the Spotify Web API. \n    It returns a list of 'Artist' instances.\n\n    Args:\n        key (spotipy.Spotify): Authenticated Spotify API client.\n        time_period (str): The time range over which to retrieve top artists. \n                           Valid values are 'short_term' (1 month), 'medium_term' \n                           (6 months), and 'long_term' (all-time).\n        n_artists (int): The number of top artists to retrieve.\n                           \n    Returns:\n        A list of 'Artist' objects representing the user's top artists.\n        \n    Raises:\n        spotipy.SpotifyException: If there is an error in the Spotify API request.\n    \"\"\"\n    sp = key \n    top_artists = sp.current_user_top_artists(time_range=time_period, limit=n_artists)\n    top_thirty_artists = []\n    for i in range(n_artists):\n        top_thirty_artists.append(Artist(top_artists['items'][i]['name'], \n                                      top_artists['items'][i]['id'], \n                                      top_artists['items'][i]['images'][0]['url'], \n                                      top_artists['items'][i]['popularity'], i + 1))\n    return top_thirty_artists\n```\n\n## Import Libraries, Modules, and Environment Variables\nBefore I can collect data and visualize my network of Spotify artists, I need to obtain a Spotify authentication token. This can be done with a number of parameters available through the \n<a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started\">Spotify Developer portal</a>. \n\nI also define two variables -- `N_ARTISTS` and `TIME_PERIOD` -- in the following code chunk. Knowing my tendency to listen to a few artists in a high concentration, I opted to query only my top 30 artists. Querying more artists may lead to a more interesting graph but poses the risk of diluting the focus of the analysis. Including artists I hardly listen to in my analysis will provide little insight into my music taste. As for the time period I'll be querying, I opted to go with my data from the last six months (medium term). \n\n```{python}\n# main.py\nimport spotipy \nfrom spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth\nfrom data_classes import Artist\nfrom data_functions import collect_top_artists, collect_related_artists\nimport dotenv\nimport os \nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pyvis.network import Network\n\n# Load environment variables\ndotenv.load_dotenv()\n \nCLIENT_ID = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID\")\nCLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET\")\nREDIRECT_URI = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI\")\nSCOPE = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_SCOPE\")\n\n# Authenticate your Spotify account -- this will be your key\nsp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(client_id=CLIENT_ID, \n                                               client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,\n                                               redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI,\n                                               scope=SCOPE))\n\n# Define how many artists to query and over which length of time \nN_ARTISTS = 30\nTIME_PERIOD = \"medium_term\"\n```\n\n## Code Execution\nI am creating my network with <a href=\"https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html\">NetworkX</a> and visualizing it with <a href=\"https://pyviz.org/\">PyViz</a>. To enhance the network visualization, I'm using each artist's Spotify image to depict their node. \n\nOne thing worth noting is that Spotify's \"Fans Also Like\" is not always recriprocal. For example, Kacey Musgraves appears on Noah Kahan's \"Fans Also Like\" but he does not appear on hers. A directed graph would most commonly be used to represent this type of relationship. However, I am using an undirected graph because the presence of an artist under another artist's \"Fans Also Like\" -- even if it is not recripocated -- is reflective of a shared subset of fans. Artists who share a reciprocal connection will be connected by a bolder line, which represents an edge with greater weight.\n\n``` {python}\n#| eval: false\n# main.py\n# Store artist data in a list (note that data is stored in Artist class)\ntop_thirty_artists = collect_top_artists(sp, TIME_PERIOD, N_ARTISTS)\n\n# Collect list of artists in each artist's \"Fans also like\"\nfor artist in top_thirty_artists:\n    artist.collect_related_artists(sp)\n\n# Initialize your network of artists\nN = nx.Graph()\n\n# Create a node for each of the top artists\nfor artist in top_thirty_artists:\n    N.add_node(artist.name, size=30, shape='circularImage', image=artist.image_url)\n\n# Check if each top artist is in the other top artists' \"Fans also like\" \n# If edge already exists, adjust the weight; create edge if one does not exist \nfor artist in top_thirty_artists:\n    for different_artist in top_thirty_artists:\n        if artist != different_artist:\n            if artist.name in different_artist.related_artists:\n                if N.has_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name):\n                    N[artist.name][different_artist.name]['weight'] += 1\n                else:\n                    N.add_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name, weight=1, color=\"black\")\n\n# Store the betweenness centrality of each artist in a dictionary\ncentrality_values = nx.betweenness_centrality(N)\n\n# Store the degree centrality of each artist in a dictionary\ndegree_values = nx.degree_centrality(N)\n\nnet_test = Network(notebook=True, directed=False, height='95vh', width='100%')\nnet_test.from_nx(N)\nnew_test_path = 'graph.html'\nnet_test.show(new_test_path)\n\n```\n\n```{python}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| echo: false\nimport json\nfrom data_functions import test_collect_related_artists\n\ndef load_data(filename):\n    with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n        return json.load(f)\n#| include: false\ndata_filename = 'top_artists_data_30.json'\n\nif os.path.exists(data_filename):\n    # Load data from the file\n    top_artists_data = load_data(data_filename)\n    top_ten_artists = [Artist(**artist) for artist in top_artists_data]\nelse:\n    # Collect artist information\n    top_ten_artists = collect_top_artists(sp, time_period, n_artists)\n    \n    # Convert Artist objects to dictionaries to save to file\n    top_artists_data = [artist.__dict__ for artist in top_ten_artists]\n    save_data(top_artists_data, data_filename)\n\n# Collect list of artists in each artist's \"Fans also like\" if not already loaded\ntest_collect_related_artists(sp, top_ten_artists)\n\n# Initialize your network of artists\nN = nx.Graph()\n\n# Create a node for each of the top artists\nfor artist in top_ten_artists:\n    N.add_node(artist.name, size=50, shape='circularImage', image=artist.image_url)\n\n# Check if each top artist is in the other top artists' \"Fans also like\" \n# If edge already exists, adjust the weight; create edge if one does not exist \nfor artist in top_ten_artists:\n    for different_artist in top_ten_artists:\n        if artist != different_artist:\n            if artist.name in different_artist.related_artists:\n                if N.has_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name):\n                    N[artist.name][different_artist.name]['weight'] += 1\n                else:\n                    N.add_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name, weight=1, color=\"black\")\n\ncentrality_values = nx.betweenness_centrality(N)\n# print(centrality_values)\ntop_three_betweenness = sorted(centrality_values.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)[:3]\n# for artist, value in top_three_betweenness:\n#     print(f'{artist}: {value}')\n\ndegree_values = nx.degree_centrality(N)\n# print(degree_values)\ntop_three_degree = sorted(degree_values.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)[:3]\n# for artist, value in top_three_degree:\n#     print(f'{artist}: {value}')\n\nnet_test = Network(notebook=True, directed=False, height='95vh', width='100%', cdn_resources='in_line')\nnet_test.from_nx(N)\nnew_test_path = 'graph30.html'\n#net_test.show(new_test_path)\n```\n\n## Results\n_Zoom within the frame for a better view of the artists. Click and drag nodes to move artists._\n<iframe src=\"graph30.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nI am using _cluster_ in accordance with John Scott's definition: \"An area of relatively high density in a graph\" (2000, p. 127).\n:::\n\nAt first glance, the graph reveals two distinct clusters. In addition to those two clusters, there are five artists without any connections; they are completely isolated from the rest of the network. \n\nOne metric we can use to describe the graph is inclusiveness, \"...the number of points that are included within the various connected parts of the graph\" (Scott, 2000, p. 70). __Considering five of my top 30 artists are without any connections, the inclusiveness of my network (expressed as a proportion) is 0.83.__ A perfectly inclusive network would have an inclusiveness score of 1. Without other Spotify networks to compare to, it is impossible for me to say if my network of top artists is highly or minimally inclusive.  \n\nTo better understand which artists are most important in my network, I turned to centrality measures. The two centrality measures I'm interested in for this project are betweenness centrality and degree centrality. \n\nBetweenness centrality measures \"...the extent to which a particular point lies 'between' the various other points in the graph\" (Scott, 2000, 87). One can think of betweenness centrality as a measure of how important a node is as a \"bridge\" between other nodes. __The artists with the two highest betweenness centrality scores in my network are The Weeknd and Noah Kahan.__ The Weeknd's role as a bridge is especially apparent as he is the sole connector between my \"pop\" artists and \"hip hop/R&B\" artists.\n\nDegree centrality is effectively a popularity score as it measures how many nodes a node is connected to. __The Weeknd, Gregory Alan Isakov, and Billie Eilish tied for the highest degree centrality with a 0.28.__ \n\n__Network analysis reveals that my music taste is not one-dimensional and is most strongly characterized by two distinct clusters of artists. The Weeknd's role as both a connector and highly popular figure in my network of artists underscores his significance in my music preferences.__\n\n## Future Applications\nWhile this project utilized network analysis for its descriptive power, network analysis can also be used for predictive purposes. One such use case would be a recommendation system to recommend new artists whose music a person is likely to enjoy. Beyond music preferences and listening habits, network analysis offers valuable applications in a number of business contexts. For example, network analysis may be immensely valuable in a merger and acquisition, where seamless integration is of the utmost importance. Network analysis could reveal structural holes and knowledge gaps that would have the potential to lead to a loss of tribal knowledge and disrupt integration processes. \n\n## References\n_Fans also like_.

As for the time period I'll be querying, I opted to go with my data from the last six months (medium term). \n\n```{python}\n# main.py\nimport spotipy \nfrom spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth\nfrom data_classes import Artist\nfrom data_functions import collect_top_artists, collect_related_artists\nimport dotenv\nimport os \nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pyvis.network import Network\n\n# Load environment variables\ndotenv.load_dotenv()\n \nCLIENT_ID = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID\")\nCLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET\")\nREDIRECT_URI = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI\")\nSCOPE = os.getenv(\"SPOTIFY_SCOPE\")\n\n# Authenticate your Spotify account -- this will be your key\nsp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(client_id=CLIENT_ID, \n                                               client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,\n                                               redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI,\n                                               scope=SCOPE))\n\n# Define how many artists to query and over which length of time \nN_ARTISTS = 30\nTIME_PERIOD = \"medium_term\"\n```\n\n## Code Execution\nI am creating my network with <a href=\"https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html\">NetworkX</a> and visualizing it with <a href=\"https://pyviz.org/\">PyViz</a>. To enhance the network visualization, I'm using each artist's Spotify image to depict their node. \n\nOne thing worth noting is that Spotify's \"Fans Also Like\" is not always recriprocal. For example, Kacey Musgraves appears on Noah Kahan's \"Fans Also Like\" but he does not appear on hers. A directed graph would most commonly be used to represent this type of relationship. However, I am using an undirected graph because the presence of an artist under another artist's \"Fans Also Like\" -- even if it is not recripocated -- is reflective of a shared subset of fans. Artists who share a reciprocal connection will be connected by a bolder line, which represents an edge with greater weight.\n\n``` {python}\n#| eval: false\n# main.py\n# Store artist data in a list (note that data is stored in Artist class)\ntop_thirty_artists = collect_top_artists(sp, TIME_PERIOD, N_ARTISTS)\n\n# Collect list of artists in each artist's \"Fans also like\"\nfor artist in top_thirty_artists:\n    artist.collect_related_artists(sp)\n\n# Initialize your network of artists\nN = nx.Graph()\n\n# Create a node for each of the top artists\nfor artist in top_thirty_artists:\n    N.add_node(artist.name, size=30, shape='circularImage', image=artist.image_url)\n\n# Check if each top artist is in the other top artists' \"Fans also like\" \n# If edge already exists, adjust the weight; create edge if one does not exist \nfor artist in top_thirty_artists:\n    for different_artist in top_thirty_artists:\n        if artist != different_artist:\n            if artist.name in different_artist.related_artists:\n                if N.has_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name):\n                    N[artist.name][different_artist.name]['weight'] += 1\n                else:\n                    N.add_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name, weight=1, color=\"black\")\n\n# Store the betweenness centrality of each artist in a dictionary\ncentrality_values = nx.betweenness_centrality(N)\n\n# Store the degree centrality of each artist in a dictionary\ndegree_values = nx.degree_centrality(N)\n\nnet_test = Network(notebook=True, directed=False, height='95vh', width='100%')\nnet_test.from_nx(N)\nnew_test_path = 'graph.html'\nnet_test.show(new_test_path)\n\n```\n\n```{python}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| echo: false\nimport json\nfrom data_functions import test_collect_related_artists\n\ndef load_data(filename):\n    with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n        return json.load(f)\n#| include: false\ndata_filename = 'top_artists_data_30.json'\n\nif os.path.exists(data_filename):\n    # Load data from the file\n    top_artists_data = load_data(data_filename)\n    top_ten_artists = [Artist(**artist) for artist in top_artists_data]\nelse:\n    # Collect artist information\n    top_ten_artists = collect_top_artists(sp, time_period, n_artists)\n    \n    # Convert Artist objects to dictionaries to save to file\n    top_artists_data = [artist.__dict__ for artist in top_ten_artists]\n    save_data(top_artists_data, data_filename)\n\n# Collect list of artists in each artist's \"Fans also like\" if not already loaded\ntest_collect_related_artists(sp, top_ten_artists)\n\n# Initialize your network of artists\nN = nx.Graph()\n\n# Create a node for each of the top artists\nfor artist in top_ten_artists:\n    N.add_node(artist.name, size=50, shape='circularImage', image=artist.image_url)\n\n# Check if each top artist is in the other top artists' \"Fans also like\" \n# If edge already exists, adjust the weight; create edge if one does not exist \nfor artist in top_ten_artists:\n    for different_artist in top_ten_artists:\n        if artist != different_artist:\n            if artist.name in different_artist.related_artists:\n                if N.has_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name):\n                    N[artist.name][different_artist.name]['weight'] += 1\n                else:\n                    N.add_edge(artist.name, different_artist.name, weight=1, color=\"black\")\n\ncentrality_values = nx.betweenness_centrality(N)\n# print(centrality_values)\ntop_three_betweenness = sorted(centrality_values.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)[:3]\n# for artist, value in top_three_betweenness:\n#     print(f'{artist}: {value}')\n\ndegree_values = nx.degree_centrality(N)\n# print(degree_values)\ntop_three_degree = sorted(degree_values.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)[:3]\n# for artist, value in top_three_degree:\n#     print(f'{artist}: {value}')\n\nnet_test = Network(notebook=True, directed=False, height='95vh', width='100%', cdn_resources='in_line')\nnet_test.from_nx(N)\nnew_test_path = 'graph30.html'\n#net_test.show(new_test_path)\n```\n\n## Results\n_Zoom within the frame for a better view of the artists. Click and drag nodes to move artists._\n<iframe src=\"graph30.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nI am using _cluster_ in accordance with John Scott's definition: \"An area of relatively high density in a graph\" (2000, p. 127).\n:::\n\nAt first glance, the graph reveals two distinct clusters. In addition to those two clusters, there are five artists without any connections; they are completely isolated from the rest of the network. \n\nOne metric we can use to describe the graph is inclusiveness, \"...the number of points that are included within the various connected parts of the graph\" (Scott, 2000, p. 70). __Considering five of my top 30 artists are without any connections, the inclusiveness of my network (expressed as a proportion) is 0.83.__ A perfectly inclusive network would have an inclusiveness score of 1. Without other Spotify networks to compare to, it is impossible for me to say if my network of top artists is highly or minimally inclusive.  \n\nTo better understand which artists are most important in my network, I turned to centrality measures. The two centrality measures I'm interested in for this project are betweenness centrality and degree centrality. \n\nBetweenness centrality measures \"...the extent to which a particular point lies 'between' the various other points in the graph\" (Scott, 2000, 87). One can think of betweenness centrality as a measure of how important a node is as a \"bridge\" between other nodes. __The artists with the two highest betweenness centrality scores in my network are The Weeknd and Noah Kahan.__ The Weeknd's role as a bridge is especially apparent as he is the sole connector between my \"pop\" artists and \"hip hop/R&B\" artists.\n\nDegree centrality is effectively a popularity score as it measures how many nodes a node is connected to. __The Weeknd, Gregory Alan Isakov, and Billie Eilish tied for the highest degree centrality with a 0.28.__ \n\n__Network analysis reveals that my music taste is not one-dimensional and is most strongly characterized by two distinct clusters of artists. The Weeknd's role as both a connector and highly popular figure in my network of artists underscores his significance in my music preferences.__\n\n## Future Applications\nWhile this project utilized network analysis for its descriptive power, network analysis can also be used for predictive purposes. One such use case would be a recommendation system to recommend new artists whose music a person is likely to enjoy. Beyond music preferences and listening habits, network analysis offers valuable applications in a number of business contexts. For example, network analysis may be immensely valuable in a merger and acquisition, where seamless integration is of the utmost importance. Network analysis could reveal structural holes and knowledge gaps that would have the potential to lead to a loss of tribal knowledge and disrupt integration processes. \n\n## References\n_Fans also like_.
